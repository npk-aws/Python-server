The given code is a minimalistic Python script for creating a basic web server that responds with "Hello, World!" to any HTTP GET request. 
It uses the built-in http.server module in Python.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Import Statements:

from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
from socketserver import TCPServer

These import statements bring in the necessary classes (SimpleHTTPRequestHandler and TCPServer) from the http.server and socketserver modules, respectively.

2. HelloWorldHandler Class:

class HelloWorldHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b'Hello, World!')

This class inherits from SimpleHTTPRequestHandler and overrides the do_GET method. This method is called whenever a GET request is received. 
It sends a 200 OK response with a simple "Hello, World!" message in the response body.

3. Server Configuration and Startup:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server_address = ('', 8000)
    httpd = TCPServer(server_address, HelloWorldHandler)
    print('Server running on port 8000...')
    httpd.serve_forever()

This block of code checks whether the script is being run as the main module (__name__ == "__main__") and, if true, it configures the server to
listen on port 8000 and starts serving requests indefinitely.
